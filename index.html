<p><strong>Palladium Coin</strong></p>
<p><strong>About:</strong></p>
<p>the palladium chain project came as a stimulus and example for the creation of blockchain-based technologies and smart contracts. linked to precious metals and collectibles due to their authenticity and immutability.</p>
<p>a slowly developed project where carefully and professionally analyzed every detail and every idea, with low cost development due to a low budget limit.</p>
<p>The project brings with it the idea of ​​the possibility of linking technology to a metal, be it collectibles or means of exchange, facilitating its identification and authentication through intelligent means linked to blockchain technology.</p>
<p>technology in which it would not only be in digital form, but in physical form where palladium coins and other precious metals are manufactured with contract identification device in the blockchain.</p>
<p>A kind of magnetic card reader where it collects details on a chip inserted inside the coin to identify the metal's technological values, a way of linking metal+technology, thus assigning two types of values ​​to the object,</p>
<p>physical value of metal<br />+<br />digital value of technology</p>
<p>such as inserting an amount of bitcoins inside a currency chip where the asset holder can insert a dynamic amount of cryptoactives thus providing a certain technological value to the object.</p>
<p>however the part of the project in which I mention physical means will not count at the beginning of the project since the budget limit for development is extremely low, but the digital technological part will be manufactured, thus leaving open the possibility of technological development linked to metals used in means of exchange as collectibles of precious metals.</p>
